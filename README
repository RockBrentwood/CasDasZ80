CasDasZ80
━━━━━━━━━
Included in this repository is the source code for a Z80 assembler and disassembler,
as well as tables, in HTML, for the opcode formats formats for:
	8080, 8085, Z80, 8088
The assembler and disassembler are being remade as the CAS assembler and DAS disassembler,
currently in the CPU repository under csd4-archive for the 8051,
as part of the process of porting the CAS and DAS to the 8080/8085/Z80 and even 8086/8088.

The Z80 CPU was widely used in the 1980's in many home computers.
Even today it is often used as a cheap embedded CPU.

DasZ80 Disassembler
───────────────────
Originally Z80 Disassembler, it was created by Markuz Fritze (sarnau),
as a small disassembler for a Z80 CPU in an afternoon.
It is a command-line tool.
It is gradually being migrated over to the design of the DAS disassembler,
which currently only has a public-facing port for the 8051,
(currently under https://github.com/RockBrentwood/CPU/tree/main/8051/csd4-archive/assem),
and previously also had a local port for the 8080 and 8085.
There is enough congruence in their designs to facilitate the migration to DAS.

This program should compile with any C++ compiler.
It only uses some ANSI C functions (look into ‟main()”).
C++98 should be sufficient, compatibility should continue to hold for C++11 on up, for future changes.
Current program versions can be compiled successfully with ‟g++”.
Z80DisAssembler has also compiled with ‟clang” without warnings, therefore DasZ80 should, as well.

This program is freeware.
It may not be used as a base for a commercial product!

CasZ80 Assembler
────────────────
Originally the Z80 assembler, it was created by Markuz Fritze (sarnau),
as an assembler for the Z80, a few days after the Z80 disassembler was created,
to compile the changes coded from the disassembler into an EPROM image
and build a new firmware for Markuz' aquarium computer.
Almost two days were needed for the assembler, this means: command-line only...
If you want to change the filename of the sourcefile, you have to change main().

This small assembler has some nice gadgets:
it is a quite fast tokenizing single-pass assembler with backpatching.
It knows all official Z80 opcodes and some undocumented opcodes (mainly with ‟IX” and ‟IY”).
The Z80 syntax is documented in the Zilog documentation.

It is being slated for migration to a Z80 port of the CAS assembler,
whose only public-facing port currently is for the 8051
(also under https://github.com/RockBrentwood/CPU/tree/main/8051/csd4-archive/assem).
There is enough congruence in the design of the Z80 assembler with the CAS assembler,
which is also a single-pass assembler with backpatching,
to facilitate the migration to a Z80 port of the CAS.

The assembler allows mathematical expressions in operands:
	‟+”, ‟-”, ‟*”, ‟/”, ‟%” (modulo),
	‟&” (and), ‟|” (or), ‟!” (not), ‟^” (xor), ‟<<” (shift left) and ‟>>” (shift right).
Brackets are also available.
The expression parser is located in ‟Exp.cpp”.
Numerals can be suffixed by a ‟D”, "O" (or "Q"), ‟H” or ‟B” for decimal, octal, hexadecimal and binary numerals.
Numerals prefixed by a ‟$” are recognized as hexadecimal.

The assembler also knows the most commend pseudo opcodes (look into the sourcefile ‟Lex.cpp”):
‟;”		This line is a comment.
‟IF”		Start the conditional expression.
		If false, the following sourcecode will be skipped (until ‟ELSE” or ‟ENDIF”).
‟ENDIF”		End of the condition expression.
‟ELSE”		Include the following code, when the expression on ‟IF” was false.
‟END”		End of the sourcecode.
		The assembler stops here.
		Optional.
‟ORG”		Set the PC in the 64k address space.
		E.g. to generate code for address $2000.
‟PRINT”		Print the following text on the console.
		Great for testing the assembler.
‟EQU”/‟=”	Set a variable.
‟DEFB”/‟DB”	Put a byte at the current address
‟DEFW”/‟DW”	Put a word at the current address (little endian!)
‟DEFM”/‟DM”	Put a string or several bytes seperated with a ‛,’ in the memory, starting at the current address.
‟DEFS”/‟DS”	Set the current address n bytes ahead.
		Defines space for global variables that have no given value.
